Plugin providing all functions needed to make X Theme 100% compatible with GeoDirectory

== Description ==

With [GeoDirectory plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/geodirectory) and the compatibility pack you can Turn your X Theme powered website into an interactive Business Directory!

Given the high number of requests for 100% compatibility with this theme layout, we decided to pack the necessary functions and css hacks in a simple plugin.

The plugin does a very simple thing. Through action hooks and filters, it removes the default html wrappers from GeoDirectory templates and adds X html wrappers. 

This make GeoDirectory pages display gracefully when used with X.
